### **Predicting House Prices with Regression**

Welcome to the repository for my **first internship project** at **Prodigy InfoTech**! This project focuses on implementing a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

## **Project Overview**

This project is a part of my Machine Learning internship, where I have applied fundamental concepts of linear regression to real-world data. The goal is to predict housing prices, offering insights into how different factors influence the market.

## **Google Colab Notebook**

All work for this project is documented in a Google Colab notebook named [`ProdigyInfoTech_ML_Task_01.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1u7y_3EwCCigD4r3CwvmLoctuLY4U4sSH?usp=sharing). The notebook includes:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Steps for data collection, cleaning, and preparation.
- **Model Implementation:** Training and evaluating the linear regression model.
- **Visualizations:** Graphs and plots to illustrate model performance and feature relationships.

## **Key Features**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Ensures the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.
- **Model Implementation:** Builds a robust linear regression model.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Uses metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to evaluate the model.
- **Visualization:** Graphs and plots that depict the model's performance and the relationship between features and house prices.

## **Data Sources**

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle, specifically the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) competition.

To download the dataset, use the following code in your Colab notebook:

```python
!pip install opendatasets
import opendatasets as od
od.download("https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data")
```

## **Installation & Usage**

To view and run the project:

1. Open the Colab notebook: [`ProdigyInfoTech_ML_Task_01.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1u7y_3EwCCigD4r3CwvmLoctuLY4U4sSH?usp=sharing).
2. Run each cell to execute the code and see the results.

## **Results & Discussion**

The linear regression model demonstrates a solid performance, accurately predicting house prices with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The project showcases the importance of feature selection and data preprocessing in building predictive models.

## **Future Work**

In future iterations, I plan to explore more advanced machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, to enhance prediction accuracy.

## **Acknowledgments**
